**NOTES FOR USERS WITH BUFFERING**

In some cases you see short periods of buffering, the reason for this is that KODI is not caching any data but simply streaming as it needs to.

Sometimes you will have scenes where the need for data is higher than the speed you can download new material from the server, in those cases buffering will occur, to get around this it is possible to let KODI cache more data to avoid buffering in scenes which require a higher bandwidth.

You can read more about how to do it on the KODI website here: http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Modify_the_video_cache
