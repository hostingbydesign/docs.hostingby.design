A frequently asked question we get from customers is if we have support for The Lounge. At the time of writing, we don't officially support it, but it can be installed using a script a community member has written.

To follow this guide, you will need to SSH into your server. If you need help with this, please refer to the [how do I connect](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md) article.

import Community from "../snippets/community.mdx";

<Community />

## Installation

This installer will use your existing username and a password of your choice to secure The Lounge. Please consider [reading the script](https://github.com/brettpetch/hosted-scripts/raw/master/lounge.sh) before running it. The installer will output a port number with how to access The Lounge install on completion. Please remember this number.

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/brettpetch/hosted-scripts/raw/master/lounge.sh)
```

:::tip
If something goes wrong during your install, please consider checking the logs. You may find them by running the following:

```bash
less -r +G ~/.logs/lounge.log
```

These can be helpful in cases where you need to see the output from installation.
:::
On first run, go to `https://<hostname.io>:<yourportnumber>` to access The Lounge. This should ask you for a login. You will also receive a warning about SSL, which can be ignored safely.

## Controlling the Systemd Service

import UserSystemd from "../snippets/usersystemd.mdx";

<UserSystemd service="lounge" />

## Troubleshooting

#### I Can't Remember my Port Number

Please run `grep port: ~/.thelounge/config.js`

Your port number will be the first number.

#### Viewing logs

:::tip  
For application specific logs, consider running the following:

```bash
systemctl --user status lounge
```

You can exit `less` by pressing `q` at any point.
