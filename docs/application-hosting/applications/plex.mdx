Plex media server allows you to aggregate all your personal media and access it anywhere you go.

:::tip Upgrading
Upgrading your PLEX instance is a simple process, login to the webui/dashboard we provide for your service, find the "Service info" section in the page you are presented with, from there simply click "Restart" next to plex, that will restart the app and also check for updates, please note that we are usually 2-3 days behind on updates!
:::

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Plex on your slot is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install plex
```

After you issue this command, you'll receive the following notice:

```plaintext main wrap
Please visit https://www.plex.tv/claim, login, copy your plex claim token to your clipboard and paste it here. This will automatically claim your server! Please note, you will be unable to tunnel to your slot later if you do not claim it now.
```

It's not necessary to claim your server now, but it **will** make your life a bit easier after installation, as you can avoid having to claim your server after it's setup.

For convience sake, the link to grab a claim token is [here](https://www.plex.tv/claim). If you're not logged into Plex, the page will ask you to login. Once you're logged in, you'll be redirected to a page with a claim token on it. Copy this to your clipboard and paste it back in the terminal.

:::tip Tip
On Windows, under PuTTY, you can paste with a right-click.
On Linux, you'll need to use Control-Shift-V.
:::

Installation will take a few moments. Once it's done, you'll receive a notice that the installation is complete and the installer will let you know where you can access the application. (e.g. `https://app02.hostingby.design:7777/web`).

## How to Access

As above, the Plex installer will output your personal port access at the end of the installation. Since Plex doesn't have outstanding support for reverse proxies, access to Plex will be through the port it was setup on. For instance, `7777`. To access the application directly, you can use the link `https://serverhostname.io:port/web`, or, for example: `https://app02.hostingby.design:7777/web`

:::tip Tip
If you forgot your personalized port, you can always access Plex from the "Plex" link on your dashboard, or you can re-discover your port programatically with the command `cat ~/.install/.plex.lock`. However, as long as your server has been claimed, it should always be viewable from your Plex Web dashboard at https://app.plex.tv/dashboard
:::

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage Plex via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="plex" />

## Configuration

:::caution
You are welcome to change most of the settings under the server configuration; however, **you should never touch the Plex remote port, nor the manual port mapping mode under the "Remote Access" settings. Doing so will likely result in you losing access to your plex instance.**
:::

### Libraries

:::tip Paths
To find folders inside of your /home/"username" directory, you need to navigate to /data/ in Plex, as we mount your home directory under the /data/ folder!
:::

During the setup of Plex, we automatically configure two media Libraries for you. These correspond to two directories in your home folder:

- TV Shows > `~/media/TV Shows`
- Movies > `~/media/Movies`

Furthermore, if you are needing to create a custom folder to your Library (in the instance of rclone or plexdrive), you will find that your entire home directory has been mounted under the /data folder of your Plex instance.

### Manual claiming

If you skipped claiming of your Plex server during installation, you can still claim it manually, but you'll need to create an SSH Tunnel to your server to appear as if you're using the same network as your Plex instance.

If you've gotten this far, I'll assume you don't need any reminders on how to connect to the server via SSH ;) However, creating an SSH tunnel takes a bit more effort than simply creating an SSH Connection.

:::tip Plex port
To find your Plex port, you need to SSH into your slot and issue the command `cat ~/.install/.plex.lock`. This command will give you the Port Plex uses.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="windows"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
    {label: 'Linux / OS X', value: 'linux'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="windows">
 


    1. Open up your PuTTY client again.
    2. Under gateway, enter the hostname of your server, e.g.: `xx.lw/ein.itsby.design`
    3. Configure the tunnel:
        1. On the left hand side, navigate to `Connection > SSH > Tunnels`
        2. Under source port, enter 8888
        3. Login via SSH and issue this command without the quotes "cat ~/.install/.plex.lock"
        4. Under destination, enter: localhost:<plex-port> (plex-port is the number shown in step 3 with the command)
        5. Click `Add`
    4. Connect to the server by clicking `Open`
    5. PuTTY will prompt you for your username and password like a regular SSH session.
    6. Once connected, open your browser and navitage to http://localhost:8888/web
    7. The browser will connect to your Plex server and let you know that there is an unclaimed server on your network.
    8. You will see a prompt asking you to setup a new server and library, or it will state you have an unclaimed server, which you can then proceed to claim to your account.
    9. To check that it worked, just disconnect from the Plex tunnel by closing PuTTy and navigate to https://app.plex.tv and you will see your new Server there :)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux">


    1. Open a command prompt or terminal
    2. Enter the command: ssh <username>@<hostname.ltd> -L 8888:localhost:<your plex port>
    3. Open your browser window and navigate to http://localhost:8888/web
    4. The browser will connect to your Plex server and let you know that there is an unclaimed server on your network.

## Connect to other clients

If you need to link your Plex instance to another application, such as Sonarr or Tautulli, you can use the following details:

```plaintext main
Host: 127.0.0.1
Port: <your plex port>
```
