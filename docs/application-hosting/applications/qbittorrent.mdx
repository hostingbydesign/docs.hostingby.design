```

This will install a tuned qBittorrent client from HostingByDesign.

## How to Access

Accessing the web-gui is simple, just append /qbittorrent to the hostname you've been provisioned on. For instance, `https://<hostname.io>/qbittorrent/`.

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage qBittorrent via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="qbittorrent" />

## Connecting to other Software:

### Connecting to qbittorrent from a service not hosted on the service.

Open up the web-gui, as listed above. Click the settings gear icon located in the top left menu. Click Web UI, change the bind IP address to a * (For all IPs), then copy the webui port.

You can now connect to your qBittorrent instance through `http://<hostname.io>:<qbittorrent-port>` with normal qbittorrent authenication measures rather than nginx-forwarded plain http authenticaiton.
