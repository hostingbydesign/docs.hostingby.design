qBittorrent is an open-source alternative utorrent. It's written in C++ and uses Boost, Qt toolkit, and the libtorrent library to deliver a fast torrent client.

## Intital Setup

```bash
box install qbittorrent
```

This will install a tuned qBittorrent client from HostingByDesign.

## How to Access

Accessing the web-gui is simple, just append /qbittorrent to the hostname you've been provisioned on. For instance, `https://<hostname.io>/qbittorrent/`.

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage qBittorrent via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="qbittorrent" />

## Connecting to other Software:

### Connecting to a remote client (i.e. Sonarr)

Open up the web-gui, as listed above. Click the settings gear icon located in the top left menu. Click Web UI, then copy the port number listed.

You can now connect to your qBittorrent instance through `http://<hostname.io>:<qbittorrent-port>` with normal qbittorrent authenication measures rather than nginx-forwarded plain http authenticaiton.
