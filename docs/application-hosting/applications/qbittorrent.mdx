```

This will install a tuned qBittorrent client from HostingByDesign.

## How to Access

Accessing the web-gui is simple, just append /qbittorrent to the hostname you've been provisioned on. For instance, `https://<hostname.io>/qbittorrent/`.

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage qBittorrent via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="qbittorrent" />

You can now connect to your qBittorrent instance through `http://<hostname.io>:<qbittorrent-port>` with normal qbittorrent authenication measures rather than nginx-forwarded plain http authenticaiton.

## Installing qBittorrent Plugins

As a modern app, qBittorrent has support for Plugins. You can find these Plugins from the qBittorrent GitHub page [here](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki). Here is the tutorial on how to install these.

2. Move the file into this folder:
```/home/<username>/.local/share/qBittorrent/nova3/engines```
3. You may need to restart qBittorrent for the Plugin to show up.

##### SSH
1. SSH into your slot, you can find a tutorial on how to achieve this [here](https://docs.hostingby.design/application-hosting/getting-started/how-do-i-connect).
2. Issue this command:
```cd ~/.local/share/qBittorrent/nova3/engines```
3. Open your browser and go to the link in the beginning of this tutorial where the Plugins are listed. Select one Plugin and Right Click on the Download Link, select Copy Link.
4. Go back into your SSH window and issue this command:
```wget <the link you copied from your browser>```
:::tip
If using PuTTy, right clicking with your mouse will act as paste, using ctrl+v will not work.

5. After you have the link added, just hit Enter and let it download the .py file. 
6. You may require to restart qBittorrent for the Plugin to show up.
