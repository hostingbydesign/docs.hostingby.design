Ombi is a self-hosted web application that automatically gives your shared Plex or Emby users the ability to request content by themselves! Ombi can be linked to multiple TV Show and Movie DVR tools to create a seamless end-to-end experience for your users.

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Ombi is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install ombi
```

This command will configure ombi for your user.

## How to Access

After installation, Ombi will be availabe at the following web address: `https://<hostname.io>/<username>/ombi`

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage Ombi via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="ombi" />

## Configuration

On the first run of Ombi, there will be a brief setup wizard. In order to configure Ombi with Plex, simply choose Plex from the media server options and login to your account with your **plex** username and password. Ombi should now automatically be configured for use with the Plex instance on your server.

If you have further questions about settings and configurations of Ombi, please refer to the [Ombi Wiki](https://github.com/tidusjar/Ombi/wiki).
