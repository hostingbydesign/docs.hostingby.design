(py)Medusa is an automatic video library manager for TV Shows written in Python. It watches for new episodes of your favorite shows, and when they are posted it does its magic.

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Medusa is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install medusa
```

This command will configure medusa for your user.

## How to Access

After installation, you can access Medusa at the url: `https://<yourhostname.io>/medusa`

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage Medusa via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="medusa" />

## Configuration

If you are unfamiliar with Medusa, please check out their [wiki](https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/wiki) for assistance in getting your trackers setup or learning how to add shows or setup post-processing.
