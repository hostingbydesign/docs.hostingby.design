:::

```

:::caution Finish install in browser
Please make sure to finish the setup of the application through the web browser, and create your admin user.

## Access

You can access jellyfin through `https://appxx.lw.hostingby.design/<yourusername>/jellyfin`.

## Library management

By default, you home directory will be mounted in Jellyfin as `/data/`. There you will find all of the files from your home directory. If you setup an application like l3uddz autoscan with the *arrs, you may need to use a `rewrite rule` to replace `/home/username` with `/data`.

## User management

Jellyfin manages its users in a separate database. Please use the Web-UI to manage users and media.

## Service management

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="jellyfin" />

## Troubleshooting

If you were early-access to the apprange and have been experiencing issues with Jellyfin, please change your transcode hardware acceleration to "none".

Jellyfin has a general [Troubleshooting guide](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/troubleshooting.html) which we highly suggest you follow first in case you have any issues.

If you recently reinstalled Jellyfin, you may need to clear your cookies and cache for your appbox url to properly access the web interface.

If all else fails, consider putting in a [ticket](https://my.hostingby.design/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=2).
