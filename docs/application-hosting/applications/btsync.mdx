Resilio Sync (formerly BitTorrent Sync) is a peer-to-peer file synchronization tool available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Amazon Kindle Fire and BSD. It can sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet via a modified version of the BitTorrent protocol.

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing Resilio is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install btsync
```

This command will configure btsync for your user.

## How to Access

After Resilio Sync has been configured for your user, the application can be accessed from your web browser at `https://<domain.io>/btsync`

## Service Management

Like all box configured applications, you can manage btsync via SSH with box with start, stop, restart, enable and disable commands.

import SystemdTabs from "../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx";

<SystemdTabs service="btsync" />
