WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography

## Initial Setup

First you must connect to your slot via ssh. If you need help connecting to the server, please read the help article [here](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md).

Installing wireguard is easy. Simply issue the following command:

```plaintext main
box install wireguard
```

This command will configure wireguard for your user. When install finished, the installer will output the configuration for your user. This is an example configuration:

```plaintext main
[Interface]
Address = 10.100.0.2
PrivateKey = {averysecretkey}
ListenPort = 21841

[Peer]
PublicKey = {apublickey}
Endpoint = {shared/dedicated IP}:{port}
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0

# This is for if you're behind a NAT and
# want the connection to be kept alive.
#PersistentKeepalive = 25
```

## How to Access

### Client Install

In order to use the Wireguard tunnel, you'll need to install the client on your local computer or mobile phone. In order to get started, please check the [Wireguard site](https://www.wireguard.com/install/) for help on installing Wireguard on the operating system of your choice.

:::note
If you prefer, and alternate client called [TunSafe](https://tunsafe.com/download) exists and is already a bit more mature than the official Wireguard client for Windows. **While the client itself is open-source and developed by a community member with prior credibility, it bears mentioning that using this client completely, 100% at your own risk as it is not developed or maintained by the Wireguard team. You have been warned.**

### Client Setup

Wireguard is available on many platforms. Setting it up for use with your HostingByDesign configuration should be fairly straight-forward, but in case you need a littl help getting your client setup, here are some instructions for popular operating systems.

#### Linux / OS X

1. Simply copy-paste the configuration file outputted at the end of the server setup into a file in /etc/wireguard.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
sudo chmod 600 /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

2. Wireguard should now be up and tunnelling all you traffic through HostingByDesign.
3. [Check your IP Address](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ip+address&ia=answer). It should now reflect your shared or dedicated IP for your slot.

4. On Linux systems, you can configure a systemd service to automatically run and enable this configuration on each boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

#### Windows

1. Copy-paste the contents of the client configuration outputted at the end of configuration into a file onto your local desktop,eg: `HostingByDesign.conf.d`

2. Open TunSafe, click and drag the configuration file you just created to the TunSafe window. TunSafe will automatically import the client configuration and connect. Easy!

3. [Check your IP Address](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ip+address&ia=answer). It should now reflect your shared or dedicated IP for your slot.

#### Android

Configuration is easiest if you use utilize the QR Encode function.

1. Connect to your server from a computer and issue the commands:

```bash
u=$(whoami)
qrencode -t ansiutf8 < ~/.wireguard/$u.conf
```

2. In your client on your phone, add a new tunnel and chose the `QR Code` option. Scan the QR code which was generated in your terminal.
3. Enable the tunnel by ticking the switch.
