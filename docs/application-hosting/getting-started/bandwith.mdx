Each of our packages come with a predefined amount of upload traffic, how much included traffic is mentioned on each individual product - We only count outgoing data, but there are some few protocols that are exempt from the usage.

1. FTP/FTPS (All data sent to your home via FTP)
2. HTTPS transfers to your home
3. All media servers (PLEX, Emby, Jellyfin)

The above 3 items do not count in your usage, all other outgoing data will count, this includes all torrent uploads, usenet uploads, rclone uploads cloud storage vendors etc.

:::caution
If you hit the limit on your package then the outgoing network speed will be throttled to 10Mbit!
