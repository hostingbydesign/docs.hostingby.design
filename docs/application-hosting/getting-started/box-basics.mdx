`box` is a homegrown application that will help you install applications on your server and manage their services.

This is only available via [SSH](./how-do-i-connect).

## Commands

In order to use the installer and management functions on your slot, you'll need to use the included management script: `box`.

`box` has several functions, which we'll go over here:

- `help`
- `list`
- `install`
- `remove`
- `chpasswd`
- `service management`
- `bw`

### help

The function of help is basic: provide you usage details on how to use box and the commands available to you.

Syntax:
```bash
box help
```

### list

This function lists the applications currently available for installation and a quick description of the application.

Syntax:
```bash
box list
```

### install

The commands used to install applications from the server. If you need help with specific commands, they are available on the application sub-pages here.

Syntax:
```bash
box install rtorrent
```

### remove

The commands used to remove applications from the server. If you need help with specific commands, they are available on the application sub-pages here.

Syntax:
```bash
box remove rtorrent
```

### chpasswd

Use this command when you'd like to change your password. `chpasswd` will change the password for SSH, FTP, HTTP and Deluge.

Syntax:
```bash
box chpasswd
```

### Service Management
You can manipulate service status with `start/stop/restart/enble/disable`. These commands will send the info straight to `systemctl`.

import SystemdTabs from '../snippets/systemdtabs.mdx';

<SystemdTabs service="wireguard"/>

### bw
You can get a picture of your current bandwidth usage for the month with this command.

Syntax:
```bash
box
```
