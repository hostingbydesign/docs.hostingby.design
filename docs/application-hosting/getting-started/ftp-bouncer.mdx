If you are experiencing slow throughput via FTP when you are sending/downloading data off our application hosting, then you can use the below servers to try and get around poor peering.

The service requires a custom domain name when you wish to login, so please check below.

- Username: `<username>@X.X.itsby.design` (Where X.X refers to the server you are on, fx 8.lw if you are on that server, you can find the server in your welcome email and inside the clientarea)
- Password: `<regular password for ftp>`

As for hostnames on the bouncer nodes, ie the server you have to actually connect to:

| Location    | Hostname                    | Details                                                                            |

:::caution
Please also note that the bouncers ONLY support FTPS (Explicit TLS) on port 21, it does not serve SFTP or Impicit SSL.
:::

As another side note, it is not always a given that the bouncer nodes are an improvement to you, we place no guarantees on the throughput.
