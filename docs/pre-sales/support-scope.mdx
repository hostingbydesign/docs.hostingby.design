## Dedicated servers

For bare metal dedicated servers we also provide assistance in these areas.

- Hardware issues and troubleshooting of hardware issues
- Provisioning and configuration assistance of additional IPs/ranges including IPv6
- Reinstallation of the base OS

## What we do not provide support with

- Any software installation on bare metal dedicated servers

- Further expansion from the base usage of an application, this can be adding additional custom scripts, addons or similar
- Guidance in any way or any assistance in any way in using our services for any governing law
