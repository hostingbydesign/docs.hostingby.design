Moving your seedbox from one country to another is quite easy!
We will handle the entire move for you, all you have to do is [submit a ticket](https://panel.seedbox.io/submitticket.php?step=2&deptid=2) to our support staff and they will move you to the new server.
The migration will take a few hours where your seedbox is unavailable, the time depends on the amount of data you have stored on the seedbox.
