If you are having issues with slow download speeds via FTP, using one of our bouncer servers will often provide a better experience, we constantly add more bouncer servers to our inventory and add them into our FileZilla configuration..

We recommend using FileZilla, and starting here to get the basics of the program: [Connect to FTP](/shared-storage/file-access/connect-ftp)

To start using our bouncer services, first [login to your client area](https://panel.hostingby.design/clientarea.php?action=services) and click on your service.
