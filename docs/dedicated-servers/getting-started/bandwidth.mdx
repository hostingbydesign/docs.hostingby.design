## Extra bandwidth

### Leaseweb

:::caution
If you hit the limit on your package then the network port will be shut off until next due date or until you buy extra bandwidth.
:::

If you have exceeded your included bandwidth you can buy extra. We offer the following packages:

- 10TB = €10
- 25TB = €15
- 50TB = €25
- 100TB = €40

To buy additional bandwidth open a ticket with the specified amount you want. We will then create an invoice and once that is paid we'll increase the bandwidth limit.

Should you have any questions on this, then please open a ticket!
