If you have exceeded your included bandwidth you can buy extra. We offer the following packages:

- 10TB = €10
- 25TB = €15
- 50TB = €25
- 100TB = €40
- 250TB = €75
- 500TB = €99
- Unmetered (Fair use, ~3Gbit avg) = €249

To buy additional bandwidth open a ticket with the specified amount you want. We will then create an invoice and once that is paid we'll increase the bandwidth limit.

Should you have any questions on this, then please open a ticket!
