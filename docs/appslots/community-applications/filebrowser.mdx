A frequently asked question we get from customers is if we have support for filebrowser. At the time of writing, we don't officially support it, but it can be installed using a script a community member has written.

To follow this guide, you will need to SSH into your server. If you need help with this, please refer to the [how do I connect](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md) article.

import Community from "../snippets/community.mdx";

<Community />

## Installation

This installer will use your existing username and a randomly generated password (or one of your choice) to secure filebrowser. Please consider [reading the script](https://github.com/brettpetch/hosted-scripts/raw/master/filebrowser.sh) before running it. The installer will output a port number with how to access the filebrowser install on completion. Please remember this number.

```bash
bash <(curl -sL "https://github.com/brettpetch/hosted-scripts/raw/master/filebrowser.sh")
```

:::tip
If something goes wrong during your install, please consider checking the logs. You may find them by running the following:

```bash
less -r +G ~/.logs/filebrowser.log
```

These can be helpful in cases where you need to see the output from installation.
:::
On first run, go to `https://<hostname.io>:<yourportnumber>` to access Filebrowser. This should ask you for a login. You will also receive a warning about SSL, which can be ignored safely.

## Controlling the Systemd Service

import UserSystemd from "../snippets/usersystemd.mdx";

<UserSystemd service="filebrowser" />

## Troubleshooting

#### I Can't Remember my Port Number

Run `grep "[::]:" ~/.config/Filebrowser/filebrowser.log` via ssh. This should respond with a line that looks like the following:

```plaintext
<date and time> Listening on [::]:16781
        this is your port number    ^
```

#### Viewing logs

:::tip  
For application specific logs, consider running the following:

```bash
less -r +G ~/.config/Filebrowser/filebrowser.log
```

You can exit `less` by pressing `q` at any point.
