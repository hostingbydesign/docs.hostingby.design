Overseerr is a free and open source software application for managing requests for your media library. It integrates with your existing services, such as Sonarr, Radarr, and Plex!

At the time of writing, we don't officially support Overseerr, but it can be installed using a script a community member has written.

To follow this guide, you will need to SSH into your server. If you need help with this, please refer to the [how do I connect](../getting-started/how-do-i-connect.md) article.

import Community from "../snippets/community.mdx";

## Installation

Before installation, please consider reading the installer script. You can read it on it's [github gist page](https://github.com/brettpetch/hosted-scripts/raw/master/overseerr.sh). You can run the script by using the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://github.com/brettpetch/hosted-scripts/raw/master/overseerr.sh)
```

:::tip
If something goes wrong during your install, please consider checking the logs and the output in your console. You may find them by running the following:

```bash
less -r +G ~/.logs/overseerr.log
```

These can be helpful in cases where you need to see the output from installation.
:::

On first run, go to `http://<hostname.io>:<yourportnumber>` to access Overseerr. This should ask you to setup some credentials. Keep in mind that this application is exposed on the public internet.
