Each of our packages come with a predefined amount of upload traffic, how much included traffic is mentioned on each individual product - We only count outgoing data, but there are some few protocols that are exempt from the usage.

1. FTP/FTPS (All data sent to your home via FTP)
2. HTTPS transfers to your home
3. All media servers (PLEX, Emby, Jellyfin)

The above 3 items do not count in your usage, all other outgoing data will count, this includes all torrent uploads, usenet uploads, rclone uploads cloud storage vendors etc.

:::caution
If you hit the limit on your package then the outgoing network speed will be throttled to 10Mbit!

## Extra bandwidth

If you have exceeded your included bandwidth you can buy extra. We offer the following packages:

* 2TB = €2.5
* 5TB = €5
* 10TB = €10

You can find these on the [Product Addons page](https://my.hostingby.design/cart.php?gid=addons).
